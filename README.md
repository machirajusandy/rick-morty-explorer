# Rick and Morty Explorer

This application allows users to explore characters from the Rick and Morty universe. It fetches data from the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can search for characters, filter them by status or gender, and view detailed information about each character, including the episodes they appeared in.

The project is built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and GraphQL (using Apollo Client).

## Approach and Trade-offs

*   **API Choice:** The project utilizes the public Rick and Morty GraphQL API. This allowed for a focus on frontend development and data presentation without needing to build a custom backend. The trade-off is a dependency on an external API and its specific data structures and capabilities.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid UI development and responsiveness. Global CSS variables are used for theming elements like background and text colors (e.g., `bg-[var(--background)]`).
*   **State Management:**
    *   URL-based state management is used for search queries, filters, and pagination, leveraging the Next.js router (`useSearchParams`, `useRouter` in components like [`src/components/character/SearchBar.tsx`](src/components/character/SearchBar.tsx) and [`src/components/character/CharacterFilters.tsx`](src/components/character/CharacterFilters.tsx)).
    *   Component-level state is managed with React's `useState` hook.
    *   GraphQL data caching is handled by Apollo Client, configured in [`src/lib/apollo-client.ts`](src/lib/apollo-client.ts).
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   Next.js App Router features with Server Components are used for initial data fetching on the server (e.g., in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx) and [`src/app/character/[id]/page.tsx`](src/app/character/[id]/page.tsx)).
    *   The `use` hook from React is employed in Client Components like [`src/components/character/CharacterList.tsx`](src/components/character/CharacterList.tsx) to consume promises for data fetching.
*   **GraphQL & TypeScript:** GraphQL Code Generator ([`codegen.ts`](codegen.ts)) is used to generate TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema and queries (defined in [`src/graphql/queries.ts`](src/graphql/queries.ts)). This ensures strong typing throughout the application when interacting with API data.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests are implemented using Vitest and React Testing Library for key components such as [`src/components/character/CharacterCard.tsx`](src/components/character/CharacterCard.tsx) (see test file: [`src/__tests__/CharacterCard.test.tsx`](src/__tests__/CharacterCard.test.tsx)) and [`src/components/episode/EpisodeCard.tsx`](src/components/episode/EpisodeCard.tsx) (see test file: [`src/__tests__/EpisodeCard.test.tsx`](src/__tests__/EpisodeCard.test.tsx)). Next.js specific modules like `next/image` and `next/link` are mocked in the test setup ([`src/setupTests.ts`](src/setupTests.ts), `vitest.config.mts`).
*   **Deployment:** The application is structured for easy deployment on Vercel.

## Scalability and Production Considerations (for 100,000 Daily Users)

### Authentication

Currently, the application is a public data explorer and does not implement user authentication. For a global launch with 100,000 daily users, a robust authentication system would be crucial.

*   **Design & Implementation:**
    *   **Provider:** We would use NextAuth.js. It's a comprehensive open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It allows us to manage user sessions, integrate various OAuth providers (like Google, GitHub) if desired, or use traditional email/password credentials, giving us control over our user base and authentication flows.
    *   **Frontend (Next.js):**
        *   NextAuth.js provides hooks and components for seamless integration, handling session management (e.g., JWTs stored in HttpOnly cookies).
        *   Provide clear UI flows for login, registration, logout, and profile management.
    *   **Backend:**
        *   NextAuth.js handles the backend authentication logic, including API routes for callbacks and session management.
        *   User profile data, if extended beyond what providers offer, would be stored in a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) linked to the NextAuth.js user model.
*   **Security:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS across the entire application.
    *   NextAuth.js helps implement CSRF protection and uses secure cookies.
    *   Apply rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent abuse.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   NextAuth.js is designed to be stateless when using JWTs, allowing for horizontal scaling of application servers/functions.
    *   Ensure the user database (if used for custom profiles) can handle the load (e.g., using managed database services with read replicas).
*   **User Experience:**
    *   Offer multiple sign-in options as supported by NextAuth.js (e.g., email/password, social logins).
    *   Streamline the registration and login process.
    *   Provide clear error messaging and account recovery options.

### Search Functionality

The current search functionality relies on the filtering capabilities of the external Rick and Morty GraphQL API, implemented in components like [`src/components/character/SearchBar.tsx`](src/components/character/SearchBar.tsx) and [`src/components/character/CharacterFilters.tsx`](src/components/character/CharacterFilters.tsx). For a large-scale application where we control the backend and data:

*   **Design & Implementation:**
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Continue using client-side input handling as seen in [`src/components/character/SearchBar.tsx`](src/components/character/SearchBar.tsx).
        *   Implement debouncing for search input to reduce the number of API requests.
        *   Utilize client-side caching (Apollo Client cache is already in place: [`src/lib/apollo-client.ts`](src/lib/apollo-client.ts)) and potentially optimistic updates for a smoother UX.
        *   Support advanced filtering options in the UI.
    *   **Backend:**
        *   **Database Indexing:** Ensure all searchable fields in the primary database are properly indexed for fast lookups.
        *   **Dedicated Search Service:** For complex queries, full-text search, fuzzy matching, and relevance scoring, integrate a dedicated search engine like Algolia, Elasticsearch, or Typesense. Data would be synchronized from the primary database to this search service.
        *   **API Design:** The GraphQL API (as used with [`GET_CHARACTERS`](src/graphql/queries.ts)) is well-suited for flexible querying. Ensure API endpoints for search are optimized, support pagination, sorting, and filtering.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Caching:** Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) at the API gateway or backend level for frequently searched terms and results, complementing the client-side Apollo Cache.
    *   **Query Optimization:** Continuously monitor and optimize database queries and search engine queries.
*   **Potential Third-Party Services:**
    *   Algolia: Provides a powerful and easy-to-integrate hosted search solution.
    *   Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Offers more control and customization but requires more management (can be used via AWS OpenSearch or self-hosted).

### Monitoring Health and Performance & Maintenance

For an application with 100,000 daily users, robust monitoring and a clear maintenance strategy are essential.

*   **Monitoring Health and Performance:**
    *   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Integrate tools like Sentry, New Relic, or Datadog to track frontend and backend (serverless functions) performance, errors, and transaction traces. Vercel Analytics provides valuable insights for Next.js applications.
    *   **Log Management:** Use a centralized logging solution (e.g., Vercel Logs, Papertrail, or Grafana Loki) to aggregate logs from all parts of the application for easier debugging and analysis.
    *   **Uptime Monitoring:** Employ services like UptimeRobot or Pingdom to monitor the availability of the application and critical API endpoints (including the external GraphQL API if its stability is critical).
    *   **Key Metrics:**
        *   Page load times (Core Web Vitals).
        *   API response times and error rates (for both internal and external APIs).
        *   Serverless function execution times and error rates.
        *   Client-side JavaScript errors.
        *   Search query performance.
    *   **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on critical thresholds (e.g., high error rates, increased latency, downtime) to notify the development team immediately via Slack, PagerDuty, or email.
*   **Strategies for Ongoing Maintenance and Updates:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Utilize Vercel's tight integration with Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for automated builds, tests (including unit tests like those in [`src/__tests__`](src/__tests__)), and deployments on every push to main or pull request.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies (npm packages in [`package.json`](package.json)) using tools like `npm audit` and Dependabot to patch security vulnerabilities and leverage new features. Thoroughly test after updates.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all changes to maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch potential issues early.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review security, performance, and accessibility.
    *   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for the codebase, architecture ([`README.md`](README.md)), deployment processes, and troubleshooting guides.
    *   **Scalability Planning:** Regularly review performance metrics and Vercel usage to anticipate scaling needs.
    *   **Backup and Recovery:** While Vercel handles infrastructure, ensure any external databases or stateful services have appropriate backup and recovery plans.
